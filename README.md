## General Introduction 

SLOGERT aims to automatically extract and enrich low-level log data into an RDF Knowledge Graph that conforms to our [LOG Ontology](https://w3id.org/sepses/ns/log#). It integrates

 - [LOGPAI](https://github.com/logpai/logparser) for *event pattern* detection and *parameter* extractions from log lines
 - [Stanford NLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) for *parameter type* detection and *keyword* extraction, and 
 - [OTTR Engine](https://ottr.xyz/#Lutra) for RDF generation. 
 - [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org) for RDF data manipulation.

Currently, we have tested our approach on text-based logs produced by Unix OSs, in particular: 
  
  - Apache,
  - Kernel,
  - Syslog,
  - Auth, and 
  - FTP logs.

## What does SLOGERT do?

The main steps are shown in Figure 1 below.

Note that the seamless integration of *LogPai*, *SLOGERT*, and the *OTTR Engine* is still work in progress. Currently, using SLOGERT still involves several steps described below. Furthermore, a little bit of log pre-processing is necessary to make sure that we can capture the information about the log source. We will explain the steps in the following.

### A0. Log data pre-processing

In this step, we mainly add information about the logfile source host, i.e., the identification of the host/device that produce the log. We do this since such information can be easily retrieved, but it is not always available in the log data. This step is quite trivial and may depend on each use case. Therefore, we didn't include it as part of the main SLOGERT library.

For our sample scenario use case, we have created a small program that would do this pre-processing step plus integrating several logs of the same type (e.g., syslog) into a single file. We called it `slogert-logpai` and you can find it [here](https://github.com/sepses/slogert-logpai).

**Input**:     `data/_raw-log/<filename>.log`: the raw input of a log. 

**Output**:  `data/A1_logpai-input/<filename>.log`: the raw log file with an additional first column which identify log source hostname.

### A1. LOGPAI execution (\*.log to \*.csv)

Here, we run the LOGPAI extraction using the Drain algorithm (as suggested in the LOGPAI website based on the benchmarking report). A set of Python configuration files as input for LogPai are also provided in the data folder.

LOGPAI will produce two types of results: ```<filename>\_structured.csv```, which is the logline representation in CSV with reference to the log patterns and detected parameters, and the ```<filename>\_template.csv```, which is the log patterns detected by LOGPAI.

**Input**:     

 - `data/A1_logpai-input/<filename>.log`: enhanced raw log data    
 - `data/A1_logpai-input/<filename>.py`: LOGPAI configuration files

**Output**:    

 - `data/A1_logpai-output/<filename>\_structured.csv`: loglines in csv forms with template id and parameters    
 - `data/A1_logpai-output/<filename>\_template.csv`: logline templates as detected by LOGPAI

### A2. SLOGERT execution (\*.csv to \*.ottr)

In this step, we start the main process of templates and parameters annotation.
To this end, we need the output from A1 plus several configuration files, one (`data/config.yaml`) that contains the mapping of log data the OTTR template and the LOG/LOGEX ontologies and another one (`data/config-io.yaml`) to describe all inputs and outputs of the SLOGERT execution. 

**Input**:     

- `data/A1_logpai-output/<filename>\_structured.csv`: see A1 output above     
- `data/A1_logpai-output/<filename>\_template.csv`: see A1 output above    
- `data/A2_slogert-input/log.ttl`: LOG ontology    
- `data/A2_slogert-input/logex.ttl`: log extraction (LOGEX) ontology    
- `data/A2_slogert-input/config.yaml`: internal configuration and link to LOG and LOGEX ontologies    
- `data/A2_slogert-input/<filename>-config.yaml`: I/O configuration    

**Output**:    

- `data/A2_slogert-output/<filename>-base.ottr`: OTTR templates    
- `data/A2_slogert-output/<filename>.ottr`: OTTR instances     


### A3. LUTRA execution (\*.ottr to \*.RDF)

Here, we utilise the LUTRA jar file (v0.6.3) to transform the OTTR instances into RDF. We observe that lutra has limitation for processing large batch of loglines, so we split large(r) files into a batch of 25k log lines for lutra processing.

**Input**:     

 - `data/A2_slogert-output/<filename>-base.ottr`: OTTR templates    
 - `data/A2_slogert-output/<filename>.ottr`: OTTR instances     

**Output**:    `data/A3_lutra-output/<filename>.ttl`: RDF instances conformed to LOG ontologies.


### A4. Background Knowledge Building

We manually build a background knowledge graph for our evaluation purpose. The idea is that later on, we should be able to automatically generate such background knowledge based on network topology and other information that we can gather from domain experts. 

The knowledge should contain additional *context* information about the observed log data, e.g., temporal relations between persons, users and devices represented in log data. For now, however, we just provided examples using RDF star representation. 

**Output**:  `data/A4_background-KG/ns-slogert.ttls`: OTTR instances     


### A5. Knowledge Graph Integration

In this step, we integrated all knowledge graphs and ontologies into a single repositories for querying. We provide a dump file that you can reuse as well as link to the SPARQL endpoint.

**Input**:     

- `data/A2_slogert-input/log.ttl`: LOG ontology    
- `data/A2_slogert-input/logex.ttl`: log extraction (LOGEX) ontology    
- `data/A3_lutra-output/<filename>.ttl`: RDF instances conformed to LOG ontologies.    
- `data/A4_background-KG/ns-slogert.ttls`: OTTR instances    
- `data/port-service-list/port-service.ttl`: port-service-list    

**Output**:       
- `https://128.131.169.162:7200/repositories/sepses-transformed`: SPARQL endpoint     
- `https://128.131.169.162:7200/`: GraphDB UI for SPARQL endpoint (repo: sepses-transformed)


## Scenario execution 

In case you want to try it out yourself or apply the framework to your own logfiles, use the following steps: 

* Run LogPai to generate `<logname>_structured.csv` and `<logname>_templates.csv`. Examples of such files (already enhanced with additional column for hostname) are available on the `scenario/input` folder.  
*  Compile this project (`mvn clean install`)
*  You can set properties for extraction in the config file (e.g., number of loglines produced per file). Examples of config and template files are available on the `src/test/resources` folder (e.g., `auth-config.yaml`for auth log data). 
*  Transform the CSVs into OTTR format using the config file. By default, the following script should work on the example file. (```java -jar target/slogert-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c src/test/resources/auth-config.yaml```)
*  After the transformation finished, it will provide you with the command to execute lutra, such as the following: (``` java -jar exe/lutra.jar --library scenario/output/auth-base.ottr --libraryFormat stottr --inputFormat stottr scenario/output/auth.ottr --mode expand --fetchMissing > scenario/output/auth.ttl```) 
*  Execute the transformation of the OTTR files into RDF graph using the command above from command line. 

A script for executing transformation data for scenario has been created in the scenario folder `scenario/scenario.sh`. To run it, compile the project (`mvn clean install`) and run `./scenario/scenario.sh` from the project folder.

## Detailed depiction of SLOGERT processes (A1-A3)

The main processes of SLOGERT (A1-A3) can be separated into two parts: (i) Event Template Extraction, and (ii) Event KG Generation. 
We show these in Figure 2. Furthermore, we provide an example process on how input log data is being processed to generate both Event Template (i) and Event KG (ii) in Figure 3. Note that all links to files listed in the figure (e.g., `A1_logpai-input/auth.log`)  are available in the `data` folder within this repository.
